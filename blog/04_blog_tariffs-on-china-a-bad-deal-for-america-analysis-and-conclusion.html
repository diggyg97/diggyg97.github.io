                                <p>The following is a memo I wrote as a recommendation to the United States Trade Representative (at the time) for my Public Policy Process class at Georgetown University during the Fall of 2019 with Professor Lynn Ross acting as a representative of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Memorandum</h4>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>To:</strong> Robert E. Lighthizer, United States Trade Representative<br>
                                    <strong>From:</strong> Digvijay Ghotane, Research Assistant, Georgetown University, Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations<br>
                                    <strong>Date:</strong> 12 November, 2019<br>
                                    <strong>Subject:</strong> Tariffs on China: A Bad Deal for America - Analysis and Conclusion
                                </p>

                                <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                                <p>For the upcoming high-level meetings, <strong>I strongly recommend advocating for relaxed tariffs on imports from China</strong>. This is crucial due to concerns over potential retaliation, especially affecting US exports, notably agricultural products, and the burden imposed on American consumers. These concerns outweigh those related to the trade deficit<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>


                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                <p>President Trump<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup> in 2018, introduced increased<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup> import tariffs on China along with other countries<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>. Firstly, let's understand that tariffs, in general, create deadweight losses in the economy, which means that there may have been more transactions in the economy but due to the presence of tariffs, the number of transactions drops along with a hike in the price and reduction in the amount of traded goods and services. This price hike is usually borne by the consumer, in this case, the general American population. A policy brief by The Trade Partnership (hereinafter referred to as “the policy paper”) assesses the estimated impact of steel and aluminum tariffs<sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup>. It estimated that even though the tariffs would create around 26,000 jobs in the steel or aluminum industry, there will be a loss of about 430,000 jobs elsewhere in the US markets because of this<sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup>. The paper also noted that these tariffs alone would reduce US GDP by 0.2% in the short term<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>

                                <p>The paper further assesses that job losses are notable in the agricultural sector with an estimated loss of 6,782 jobs. This is an effect of the compensation sought by China and other countries with added tariffs on US exports in opposition to the tariffs put by the US on the import of steel and aluminum. In 2018, export growth was hampered as predicted by the paper<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup>. Agricultural exports amounted to 140 billion USD in 2018. This was a mere 1% increase from 2017, which produced a trade surplus of 10.9 billion USD which has been the smallest surplus since 2006<sup><a href="#ref9">[9]</a></sup>. This is the combined effect of increasing imports but decreasing exports.</p>

                                <p>The paper further noted that the services sector is impacted most by the tariffs. This is primarily due to the effect on the agricultural industry as explained before, along with the manufacturing industry at large, notably in steel-consuming sectors. To put this into perspective, even though higher tariffs mean more employment in the raw-material industry, a nail factory whose raw material is steel, their cost would go up which in turn will not only lead to lower wages being paid to the workers but also lead to them being laid off. Also with the tariffs in place, companies that use raw materials that are taxed heavily would want to move to other countries where they may not be highly taxed, the labor force is cheaper, and where they can export their goods or services without worrying about a counter-tariff in retaliation to US tariffs, which would further cripple the economy and lead to unemployment. This would in turn lead to what the labor union AFL-CIO<sup><a href="#ref10">[10]</a></sup> is worried about.</p>
                                

                                <h4>Current Stand</h4>
                                <p>One of the arguments given by the current Administration is US trade deficits<sup><a href="#ref11">[11]</a></sup>. The US had a trade deficit of Economists have argued that trade deficits are a good thing for the economy. Since trade deficits are measured by the difference in the total imports and exports, a deficit implies that the imports are more than the exports which translates to the American population having an expendable income to spend on goods and services that are imported. Furthermore, due to the presence of the tariffs, US exports and imports to/from China have declined in 2019<sup><a href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup>. This can be attributed to a scenario in the economy when trade deficits shrink due to the economy not doing so well.</p>

                                <p>The other concern of the administration is threats to manufacturing jobs. The trade deficit also creates unemployment since people are buying imported goods and services over nationalized goods. But this effect is very small compared to the effect of tariffs. One major cause of this unemployment is the employment of automation in manufacturing industries, which is completely uncorrelated with the trade deficit.</p>
                               

                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>All in all, the tariffs are bad for the American economy at large owing to multiple reasons explained above. There is going to be a rise in unemployment due to the tariffs and their ripple effects, harming the economy in the long run due to lower imports and exports. The Liberty<sup><a href="#ref13">[13]</a></sup> of the free market is at risk with such an intervention. The best way to go about this would be to negotiate a trade deal with China such that exports are not hampered and there is the least possible unemployment, while also keeping a check on the imports by assessing their impact on local businesses. I believe this would be instrumental in shaping the policy, but since the administration is of the opposing view, I believe you should undertake a more policy-entrepreneur stance where you soften-up the administration, by gaining consensus, to the idea of relaxing tariffs on China, by providing them with these figures<sup><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></sup>.</p>
