                                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                                <p>The United Nations (UN) stands as a pivotal international organization, tasked with promoting peace, upholding international law, and fostering global socio-economic progress. The annual General Debate (GD) of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) serves as a crucial forum for member states to address pressing issues and outline their priorities. These speeches, delivered by heads of state or government, provide valuable insights into each nation's stance on global affairs.</p>

                                <p>The United Nations General Debate Corpus (UNGDC), compiled by Jankin Mikhaylov et al. (2019), offers a comprehensive collection of these speeches in English from 1970 to 2018. In this study, I analyze this corpus to explore variations in sentiment across countries and over time. Building on prior research by Baturo & Dasandi (2017), I focus specifically on the speeches of the P5 member nations: the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and France.</p>

                                <p>Following an overview of the dataset and preprocessing steps, I employ sentiment analysis to assess the overall tone of the speeches. Additionally, I utilize structured topic modeling techniques to identify distinct themes discussed by the P5 nations. These analyses reveal prevalent topics such as millennium development goals and the principle of self-determination.</p>

                                <p>Furthermore, I propose a classification model to differentiate between speeches of the P5 member nations based on their linguistic characteristics. By examining the choice of words used in these speeches, we gain insights into the diplomatic priorities and communication strategies of these influential countries.</p>

                                <p>In summary, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of the United Nations General Debate, shedding light on sentiment trends, thematic focuses, and linguistic patterns among member nations, particularly the P5. Through these insights, we deepen our understanding of international discourse and diplomatic dynamics within the UN.</p>

                                <h4>The Data</h4>

                                <div style="text-align: center;">
                                    <img src="../assets/images/08_TextAsData/no_of_speeches_by_country.png" alt="Image description"

                                </div>

                                <p>The United Nations General Debate Corpus (UNGDC) encompasses speeches delivered by representatives from 200 member nations at the General Debate sessions of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) spanning from 1970 to 2018, all presented in English. Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of speeches by country, revealing variations in participation over time. The dataset comprises 8,093 observations, each corresponding to a country-year pair.</p>

                                <div style="text-align: center;">
                                    <img src="../assets/images/08_TextAsData/ungdc_table.png" alt="Image description"
                                        style="width: 60vh; margin: auto;">

                                </div>

                                <p>Table 1 displays a sample of the dataset, featuring columns such as 'doc_id' (file name), 'text' (speech content), 'Country' (ISO 3-letter country code), 'Session' (UNGA session), and 'Year' (year of session). Notably, 'Country' is treated as a categorical variable, while 'Session' and 'Year' are continuous variables.</p>

                                <h4>Preprocessing</h4>

                                <div style="text-align: center;">
                                    <img src="../assets/images/08_TextAsData/word_cloud_ungdc.png" alt="Image description"
                                        style="width: 60vh; margin: auto;">
                                    <figcaption>Figures 2(a) and 2(b)</figcaption><br>
                                </div>

                                <p>In preprocessing the text data from the UNGDC, a bag-of-words approach is utilized, representing each document with a set of words and phrases up to 4-grams, without considering grammar or word order. Tokenization is performed using a simple approach, as shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b), where both methods yield similar results. Punctuation, symbols, numbers, and URLs are removed, and tokens are converted into up to 4-gram tokens.</p>

                                <p>Subsequently, the tokens are transformed into a document term matrix by lowercasing all letters and removing separators, with the removal of stop words to address issues encountered in previous analyses with the dataset. Lemmatization is then applied using the lexicon hash lemma. The resulting document term matrix includes only the P5 nations, comprising 243 documents with 508,877 features and 99.33% sparsity.</p>

                                <p>To optimize the matrix, a minimum document frequency of 20 and a maximum document frequency of 170 are applied, resulting in a sparse matrix with 2,640 features and 77.58% sparsity. The minimum row sum value is 287, with a median of 958 and a mean of 1,062.</p>

                                <h4>Sentiment Differences Across Nations & Years</h4>

                                <p>The sentiment analysis was conducted using the Lexicoder Sentiment Dictionary (Young & Soroka, 2012) in R. Initially, the overall positive and negative sentiments were calculated by summing the 'negative & neg_positive' columns for negative sentiment and the 'positive & neg_negative' columns for positive sentiment. Subsequently, an average sentiment was computed by subtracting negative sentiment from positive sentiment, aggregated at both country and year levels.</p>

                                <div style="text-align: center;">
                                    <img src="../assets/images/08_TextAsData/sentiment_average_by_region.png" alt="Image description"
                                        style="width: 90vh; margin: auto;">
                                    <figcaption>Figure 3 (a): Overall Sentiment Aggregated to Country</figcaption><br>
                                </div>

                                <p>Figure 3(a) illustrates the overall sentiment of countries categorized by regions, revealing a predominance of positive sentiment across the General Debate (GD) sessions. Notably, Japan exhibits consistently positive sentiment over the years, followed by Nepal, Romania, and Egypt. Among the P5 member nations, the United States displays the highest aggregate positive sentiment. Conversely, countries such as Israel, Eritrea, and Cuba express lower positive sentiments over the years.</p>

                                <div style="text-align: center;">
                                    <img src="../assets/images/08_TextAsData/sentiment_average_by_year.png" alt="Image description"

                                </div>

                                <p>Figure 3(b) depicts the sentiment variation across GD sessions. The most positive sentiment is observed in 1975, whereas the lowest positive sentiment occurs in 2001, shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Despite fluctuations, an overall positive sentiment prevails throughout the UN General Debate, indicating a positive atmosphere within the international community.</p>

                                <h4>Classifying Speeches based on Choice of Words</h4>

                                <p>I developed a classification model using XGBoost in R to predict the country of origin based on the content of speeches, treating the choice of words as predictive features. The outcome variable is a multinomial categorical variable representing five countries: the United States (0), the United Kingdom (1), France (2), China (3), and Russia (4). By employing the 'multi:softmax' objective for multinomial classification, the model learns to classify speeches into these five classes.</p>

                                <p>The model performed impressively well during both training and testing phases. Training on a dataset comprising 197 documents, the model demonstrated high accuracy, with only a few instances of misclassification. In the test set of 46 documents, the algorithm achieved an outstanding accuracy rate of 93.48%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval ranging from 82.21% to 98.63%.</p>
