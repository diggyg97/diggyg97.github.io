                                <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
                                <p>Understanding the impact of military interventions on terrorism is a crucial inquiry,
                                    encompassing various dimensions of security: personal, social, and financial. Given
                                    its significance, it is imperative to conduct a quantitative analysis of how
                                    military interventions influence extremist activities. This analysis holds
                                    particular relevance in decision-making processes regarding whether to engage in
                                    military interventions and evaluating the legality and effectiveness of ongoing
                                    operations under international law. Moreover, it facilitates accountability for
                                    military actions, ensuring adherence to international legal frameworks.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, this paper introduces a predictive model designed to classify attack
                                    types, offering a proactive approach to counterterrorism efforts. By leveraging
                                    available intelligence on specific parameters, such as those observed in Syria,
                                    where our research identified a statistically significant impact of US-led
                                    intervention, this model enables preemptive measures to thwart potential terrorist
                                    attacks. Anticipating the type of attack before it occurs enhances preventive
                                    strategies and mitigates security risks effectively.</p>

                                <p>In our examination, we identified only two interventions—by the United States in
                                    Syria in September 2014 and by the Russian Federation in the autonomous regions of
                                    South Ossetia and Abkhazia of Georgia in August 2008—that exhibited statistically
                                    significant correlations with terrorist activity levels in their respective regions.
                                    These interventions and their ramifications are extensively discussed in this
                                    report. Furthermore, recognizing the escalating terrorist activities
                                    post-intervention in Syria, I developed a predictive model tailored to forecast
                                    terrorist activity in the region, underscoring the critical need for proactive
                                    counterterrorism measures by the United States and their allies.</p>

                                <p>Over the past two decades, global military interventions have surged, often justified
                                    by the need to support failing states or address humanitarian crises. This project
                                    focuses on analyzing military interventions by two key players, the United States of
                                    America and the Russian Federation, and their impact on terrorism. While the
                                    definition of terrorism lacks universal consensus, for this study, the definition
                                    provided by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to
                                    Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland will be utilized, leveraging their
                                    comprehensive data. Additionally, the project aims to offer a comparative analysis
                                    of interventions undertaken by these two nations.</p>

                                <p>Moreover, the project endeavors to forecast attack types based on various parameters
                                    such as city, target type, perpetrating group, and day of the week. However, before
                                    delving into the specifics of this predictive model, it's vital to contextualize the
                                    significance of this research. Reports from Reuters in April 2019 revealed a record
                                    high in global military expenditures since the end of the Cold War, with the United
                                    States leading the pack and Russia ranking among the top ten spenders. Furthermore,
                                    amidst discussions spurred by President Donald Trump's proposal in January 2020 for
                                    increased NATO involvement in the Middle East, articulated in an opinion piece by
                                    John R. Deni in The Washington Post, there arises a pertinent question: Do military
                                    interventions effectively counter terrorism? Given the ongoing conflicts in the
                                    Middle East and recent geopolitical developments such as the Trump administration's
                                    'peace-to-prosperity' plan for the Israel-Palestine issue, this question assumes
                                    critical importance in policy formulation.</p>

                                <p>Examining the implications of past interventions is equally crucial, especially
                                    concerning accountability for actions deemed illegal under international law. For
                                    instance, the unilateral intervention in Iraq, contested by former UN
                                    Secretary-General Kofi Annan as illegal, underscores the necessity of evaluating the
                                    legal and ethical dimensions of military interventions. Partly addressing this
                                    inquiry, the paper seeks to ascertain the impact of military interventions on
                                    terrorist activities.</p>

                                <p>In the aftermath of interventions, recognized belligerents become subject to
                                    international law, necessitating interventionist countries to assist affected
                                    nations in combating these belligerents. Predicting attacks becomes paramount in
                                    such scenarios, as proactive measures can be taken based on available intelligence.
                                    The United States, alongside its NATO allies, and the Russian Federation have
                                    conducted numerous interventions, forming the focus of analysis in this paper.
                                    Specifically, the impacts of US interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq and Russian
                                    interventions in South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Crimea will be examined, along with a
                                    comparative assessment of US-led and Russian interventions in Syria.</p>

                                <p>Recognizing the potential efficacy of predictive models in preempting attacks, a
                                    model will be presented to forecast attack types based on parameters outlined in the
                                    Global Terrorism Database codebook. Such predictive capabilities can aid in averting
                                    attacks by leveraging insights into terrorist group activities, target preferences,
                                    and weapon usage patterns.</p>

                                <h4>Data Analysis Overview</h4>

                                <p>The analysis primarily revolves around the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a crucial
                                    dataset for measuring terrorist activities. Initially, the GTD data was cleaned and
                                    subsetted to focus on countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Georgia, and
                                    Crimea. This involved grouping the data by day and country to obtain a daily count
                                    of events in each respective country, forming the foundation for the analysis.</p>

                                <p>Further segmentation of the data was done to examine each country individually within
                                    specific time frames known as 'windows'. For instance, the time frames selected were
                                    1996-2006 for Afghanistan, 1997-2008 for Iraq, 2009-2019 for Crimea, 2003-2014 for
                                    Georgia, and 2009-2019 for Syria. These windows facilitated a focused analysis
                                    within defined temporal boundaries.</p>

                                <p>Given the relatively low data points for Afghanistan and Georgia, additional data
                                    from the Georeferenced Event Dataset (GED) by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program was
                                    incorporated. Similar data cleaning procedures were applied to the GED data to
                                    ensure consistency across datasets.</p>

                                <p>The analysis also introduced a treatment variable denoted as 'invasion' in all
                                    datasets, indicating the timing of military interventions. Notable intervention
                                    dates include October 7, 2001, for Afghanistan (USA), March 19, 2003, for Iraq
                                    (USA), September 22, 2014, for Syria (USA), September 30, 2015, for Syria (Russia),
                                    August 27, 2014, for Crimea (Russia), and August 8, 2008, for Georgia (Russia).</p>

                                <p>The thorough data preparation undertaken lays the groundwork for an in-depth analysis
                                    of the correlation between military interventions and terrorist activities across
                                    the designated countries. The final dataset comprises the following number of
                                    observations for each country:<br><br>

                                    • Syrian Arab Republic: 1,144 observations<br>
                                    • Republic of Iraq: 1,048 observations<br>
                                    • Ukraine: 585 observations<br>
                                    • Afghanistan: 339 observations<br>
                                    • Georgia: 71 observations<br><br>
                                    These observations serve as the cornerstone for subsequent analyses, providing a
                                    robust foundation for examining the impact of military interventions on terrorism
                                    within each respective country.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Data Analysis Approach</h4>

                                <p>For constructing a classification model to predict attack types in the Syrian Arab
                                    Republic, meticulous data cleaning was conducted to eliminate unknown data points,
                                    ensuring the reliability of the dataset. The selection of the Syrian Arab Republic
                                    as the focus country is substantiated in the conclusion.</p>

                                <p>The dataset was structured with categorical dependent variables and features sourced
                                    from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), encompassing parameters such as city,
                                    weapon type, target type, perpetrator group name, and day of the week. With a total
                                    of 1009 data points, the dataset provides a robust foundation for model development.
                                </p>

                                <p>It's worth noting a known issue with the dataset regarding undercounting events from
                                    the 1900s, as highlighted by Staff (2014). However, given the study's focus on the
                                    past two decades and partial inclusion of late 1900s data, this limitation is deemed
                                    acceptable.</p>

                                    offering valuable insights into the variables under consideration.</p>

                                <h4>Methodology Overview</h4>

                                <h5>Regression Discontinuity (RD) Analysis</h5>
                                <p>
                                    The RD method is utilized for parametric analysis to assess the significance and
                                    effect of a policy or treatment. By observing a discontinuity or jump in the
                                    dependent variable at the treatment point, the impact of the treatment can be
                                    inferred. This technique is particularly useful for assessing the effect of military
                                    interventions on terrorist activities, assuming the interventions are random and not
                                    influenced by other factors. The treatment effect, labeled as 'invasion,' is
                                    analyzed in the subsequent summary tables.
                                </p>

                                <h5>Linear Regression</h5>
                                <p>
                                    Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is employed for inference and prediction.
                                    OLS aims to minimize the mean square error between observed and predicted values
                                    along a fitted line or curve. This method is suitable for part one of the project,
                                    focusing on regression discontinuity analysis, as it allows for the examination of
                                    the treatment effect without risking problems such as multicollinearity.
                                </p>

                                <h5>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier</h>
                                    <p>
                                        KNN is a supervised non-parametric lazy machine learning algorithm used for
                                        classification. It determines the class of a data point by considering the
                                        majority class among its nearest neighbors. While simple and easy to implement,
                                        KNN may struggle with less observations, large numbers of features, and noisy or
                                        missing data.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Decision Tree Classifier</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        The decision tree classifier follows a tree-like structure where each branch
                                        represents a decision rule, ultimately leading to a classified label at the leaf
                                        node. Despite being easy to visualize and interpret, decision trees can be
                                        complex and prone to overfitting noisy data. However, they are robust to
                                        irrelevant features and missing data.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5>Advantages and Disadvantages of Models</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        KNN offers simplicity and ease of interpretation but may struggle with certain
                                        data characteristics, such as large feature sets and noisy data. Decision trees
                                        provide easy visualization and handle irrelevant features well but may be biased
                                        with imbalanced data and can overfit noisy datasets. Understanding the
                                        trade-offs between these methods is crucial for selecting the most suitable
                                        approach for the classification task at hand.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4>Analysis Overview</h4>

                                    <h5>Parametric Analysis</h5>

                                    <p>The first phase of the analysis focused on determining the significance of military interventions using Regression Discontinuity (RD) models. RD models were applied to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Ukraine data to assess the impact of interventions, with the dependent variable being the number of terrorist events per day from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD).</p>

                                    <p>For each country, the treatment effect of intervention, date normalized to zero, and an interaction variable between the normalized date and treatment effect were considered as independent variables. However, the interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Ukraine did not exhibit statistically significant effects, as indicated in Tables 1, 2, and 3.</p>

                                    <p>Distinct findings emerged for Georgia and Syria. In Georgia, the Russian intervention in the autonomous regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia demonstrated a significant decrease in terrorist activities, suggesting a negative impact on terrorism (Table 4).</p>

                                    <p>The significant impact of interventions in Georgia and Syria underscores the importance of further capacity-building efforts by the state. Therefore, the development of a prediction model to anticipate attacks becomes imperative, given the observed effects of interventions on terrorist activities.</p>


                                    <h5>Non-Parametric Analysis</h5>

                                    <p>For the non-parametric aspect of the project, the analysis focused on classifying attack types using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and decision tree classifiers.</p>

                                    <p>K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm was initially employed due to its simplicity. However, it yielded poor results with an accuracy of only 2.63% using 10-fold cross-validation, likely due to the high dimensionality of the feature matrix, which consisted of 379 dummy variables representing different cities, weapon types, target types, and perpetrator groups in Syria.</p>

                                    <p>Given the unsatisfactory performance of KNN and concerns about the distribution of the outcome variable (attack type), the decision was made not to employ the Random Forest Classifier. Instead, a decision tree classifier was chosen for its interpretability and ease of visualization.</p>

                                    <p>The decision tree classifier was trained on the entire dataset, with a maximum depth determined through evaluation of different depths. The optimal depth was found to be 5, resulting in an accuracy of 84.846% using 10-fold cross-validation, which is considered good prediction accuracy.</p>

                                    <p>Additionally, the most important variables were identified using the decision tree classifier, with those having an importance proportion greater than 0.01 being selected. These variables provide insights into the factors influencing attack types in Syria.</p>

                                    <p>Overall, the decision tree classifier outperformed KNN in classifying attack types, demonstrating its effectiveness in this context.</p>

                                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                                    <p>In summary, the analysis reveals contrasting effects of military interventions on terrorism in different regions. The Russian intervention in South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2008 led to a significant decrease in terrorism, while the US-led intervention in Syria in 2014 resulted in a significant increase in terrorism. These findings underscore the complexity of the relationship between interventions and terrorism, warranting further research and collaboration with experts in Middle Eastern and Eurasian affairs to establish causality.</p>

                                    <p>Moreover, the responsibility of states in building peace following interventions, as prescribed by customary international law, is emphasized. Building upon this premise, an attack prediction model was developed for Syria using a Decision Tree Classifier, achieving an accuracy of approximately 85%. This underscores the potential of quantitative analysis tools in understanding and addressing the impact of military interventions on terrorism.</p>

                                    <p>Ethical and legal considerations arise regarding the effectiveness and repercussions of military interventions. While interventions aimed at combating extremism may not violate international law, instances where interventions exacerbate terrorism prompt critical questions regarding legality and accountability on the global stage, such as in the United Nations Security Council.</p>

                                            <li>The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non- state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of the following attributes must be present:<br>
                                                <strong>1.</strong> The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.<br>
                                                <strong>2.</strong> The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence - including property violence, as well as violence against people.<br>
                                                <strong>3.</strong> The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.<br>
                                                In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:<br>
                                                <strong>Criterion 1:</strong> The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.<br>
                                                <strong>Criterion 2:</strong> There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.<br>
                                                <strong>Criterion 3:</strong> The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law, insofar as it targets non-combatants.
