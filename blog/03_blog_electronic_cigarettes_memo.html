                                <p>The subsequent document represents a memorandum I crafted as a recommendation
                                    addressed to the Acting Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration of the
                                    United States (at that time). It was prepared for my Public Policy Process class at
                                    Georgetown University during the Fall of 2019, under the guidance of Professor Lynn
                                    Ross, who served as the Executive Assistant of the Immediate Office of the
                                    Commissioner.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Memorandum</h4>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>To:</strong> Norman E. Sharpless, Acting Commissioner, Food and Drug
                                    Administration<br>
                                    <strong>From:</strong> Digvijay Ghotane, Executive Assistant, Immediate Office of
                                    the Commissioner<br>
                                    <strong>Date:</strong> 26 September, 2019<br>
                                    <strong>Subject:</strong> Strengthening E-Cigarette Regulations for a Safer &
                                    Healthier America – Cases & Recommendations
                                </p>

                                <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                                <p>About your meeting with current Administration strategists later during the day, <strong>I
                                    would strongly urge you to take a stand toward the strengthening of electronic
                                    cigarette regulations</strong>. Nicotine, the primary substance found in e-cigarettes is
                                    highly addictive<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>. The primary concern is the
                                    extensive use of e-cigarettes by the youth today, especially by underage
                                    audiences<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>. This is primarily due to extensive
                                    advertising of e-cigarettes that is knowingly or unknowingly targeting a younger
                                    audience<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup>. Yet another concern is the adverse
                                    effect e-cigarettes have on one’s health, specifically the severe pulmonary diseases
                                    developed by people in recent times, as reported by the CDC<sup><a
                                            href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>. There are also insufficient federal standards
                                    for the manufacturing of e-cigarette devices, leading them to explode or be a fire
                                    hazard<sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup>. Hence, I’d urge you to take this
                                    stand<sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup> which is on the same tangent as the policy
                                    of the current administration<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>; also in conjunction
                                    with public opinion<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup>.</p>

                                <h4>Introduction</h4>

                                <p>Today, the issue surrounding the loose legislation or the lack thereof, for the use,
                                    sales and marketing, and manufacturing of electronic cigarettes is alarming. The
                                    current administration is in support of strengthening the legislation that surrounds
                                    e-cigarettes primarily for the safety of the public<sup><a
                                            href="#ref9">[9]</a></sup>. E-cigarettes were introduced into the US market
                                    around 2006-07<sup><a href="#ref10">[10]</a></sup>. Since their introduction
                                    e-cigarette sales have skyrocketed to $10.2B in 2018<sup><a
                                            href="#ref11">[11]</a></sup>. The use of e-cigarettes by middle and high
                                    school students has increased considerably, from 3.6M in 2017 to 4.9M in 2018<sup><a
                                            href="#ref12">[12]</a></sup>. This has ought to raise concern amongst
                                    parents and teachers of such youngsters<sup><a href="#ref13">[13]</a></sup>. A
                                    descriptive study<sup><a href="#ref14">[14]</a></sup> has found out that marketing
                                    practices for e-cigarettes may be targeted toward the youth, especially with the
                                    availability of flavors that are attractive to the younger crowd<sup><a
                                            href="#ref15">[15]</a></sup>. Moreover, the recent reports about health
                                    issues and even deaths linked to vaping have drawn public attention toward
                                    e-cigarettes<sup><a href="#ref16">[16]</a></sup>. Other reasons also include the
                                    lack of legislation for issues of manufacturing of electronic cigarettes which is
                                    leading to the lithium-ion batteries in the e-cigarettes to explode. The other side
                                    can argue that e-cigarettes offer a potential benefit to people who are trying to
                                    quit smoking, but there is no direct evidence linked to it<sup><a
                                            href="#ref17">[17]</a></sup>. Tobacco companies themselves have also lobbied
                                    for legislation to be enacted in certain states also known as the ‘Tobacco 21’
                                    campaign<sup><a href="#ref18">[18]</a></sup>. Thus, it is necessary to regulate
                                    e-cigarettes<sup><a href="#ref19">[19]</a></sup>.</p>

                                <h4>Key Issues</h4>
                                <p>• <strong>Use by Youth</strong><br><br>
                                    The CDC as well as the FDA has pointed out the extensive use of e-cigarettes amongst
                                    young students especially high and middle school going kids. Originally developed to
                                    help people quit smoking traditional cigarettes, this may also lead to youth smoking
                                    cigarettes after starting with e-cigarettes. Parents and teachers are worried about
                                    this problem that the FDA calls an ‘epidemic<sup><a href="#ref20">[20]</a></sup>.’
                                    This calls for action<sup><a href="#ref21">[21]</a></sup> not only because of the
                                    indicators in the form of numbers that suggest high use by the youth but also
                                    because of the national mood. The laws concerning the marketing of e-cigarettes are
                                    non-existent which means companies can freely advertise to anyone at the moment,
                                    which is a problem. Especially certain e-cigarette companies like JUUL marketing
                                    their product safer than cigarettes is also a big concern<sup><a
                                            href="#ref22">[22]</a></sup>.<br><br>

                                    • <strong>Health Effects</strong><br><br>
                                    Recent reports<sup><a href="#ref23">[23]</a></sup> have shown that people are
                                    developing pulmonary diseases that are linked to the use of electronic cigarettes.
                                    Little research on the safety of e-cigarettes coupled with the enforcement
                                    discretion allowance (without FDA approval) for the sale of e-cigarettes and the
                                    liquid cartridges leads to a problem that we see as a focusing event right now, i.e.
                                    people dying due to lung disease.<br><br>

                                    • <strong>Lack of Federal Standards</strong><br><br>
                                    There is a lack of federal standards when it comes to the sale of e-cigarettes and
                                    their cartridges, the manufacturing of the electronic cigarette itself, and the
                                    marketing of e-cigarettes. Currently, e-cigarettes that are in the market can be
                                    sold without assessing their safety until May 2020<sup><a
                                            href="#ref24">[24]</a></sup>. The safety standards for the manufacturing of
                                    the devices themselves are next to non-existent which makes it a huge safety concern
                                    with the devices exploding or even catching fire<sup><a
                                            href="#ref25">[25]</a></sup>.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Recommendations</h4>

                                <p>My recommendations for the problems would include increasing the costs of electronic
                                    cigarettes and their cartridges such that the youth does not have easy access to
                                    them. Another way would only allow people who want to quit smoking traditional
                                    cigarettes to acquire a vaping device or e-cigarette via a prescription<sup><a
                                            href="#ref26">[26]</a></sup>. Raising the federal age to 21, as lobbied by
                                    interest groups in many states would lead us to be in an advantageous position.
                                    Curbing the marketing of such products that are aimed at the younger generation is
                                    of utmost importance. Educational campaigns<sup><a href="#ref27">[27]</a></sup> that
                                    raise awareness about nicotine addiction and the dangers associated with e-cigarette
                                    use would likely prove beneficial.</p>

                                <p>I would urge you to move forward with the already existing 2016 regulations. At the
                                    same time, working for legislation that is similar to the Tobacco Master Settlement
                                    Agreement (MSA) concerning compensation of medical costs to states for e-cigarette
                                    related illnesses from the current market competitors. My final recommendation would
                                    be to work on legislation that would allow safer manufacturing standards for
                                    e-cigarettes as well.</p>

                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>All in all, I would urge you to push for this agenda at the moment owing to various reasons pointed out before. In my belief, the time for this policy has come<sup><a href="#ref28">[28]</a></sup>. Keeping in mind the facts, the numbers pointing out to the underage youth extensively using e-cigarettes, the focusing events on the pulmonary diseases and deaths linked to e-cigarettes, the lobbying by interest groups in various states, and the current national mood especially that of parents and teachers, while also keeping in mind the goal of security and safety of the people, this policy decision is the one that the current administration should undertake<sup><a href="#ref29">[29]</a></sup>.</p>
